Hate by Trump.com a website cataloguing all of the hate crimes Trump's fear mongering and verbal poison is responsible for

Hi developers.. today I purchased the domain www.hatebytrump.com and I need help from someone who can help me develop a simple website for it. The goal is to create a site that tracks and reposts any material on social media that has the hashtag #hatebytrump because I will start a campaign to keep track of all the racism and crazy shit that will happen to Americans as a direct result of his fear mongering. I have zero money to pay but I promise I will do my part to promote the shit out of this and make it successful to put in my considerable effort in making sure he does not get a second term, and the PR campaign and work to defeat him starts NOW!!!
Can someone help me please?

(ps. I don't hate on Trump supporters bc I am not casting everyone as inherently bad for supporting him, but I am definitely not happy with the open license the poorly behaved ones have to hate and be racist, I cannot allow that this is my way of fighting back!)
Edit I started this github but literally have no idea what I'm doing/how to push this forward -help!

Basically what I want it to do is reshare/link any social media activity that has the hashtag and also allow me to upload photos/articles to share
